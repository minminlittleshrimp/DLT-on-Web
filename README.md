# DLT PLUGIN
## Brief description about the project!

### 1.  Scope:

   -The aim of this project is to create a plugin used for log viewing on website. The plugin is first used for local network and then can be enhance for online update (might be realtime).
### 2.  Background:

   -First, the idea is to simply build a tool helping user or client view the log data stored inside the system. The tool must contain a feature helping browse action and can upload the log file onto web page. Then the web page will be written in HTML.

### 3.  Requirements and Limits:
    
#### a.     Requirements:

   -Web page (UI) must be user-friendly and be able to detect correctly the log files.
   -The plugin can upload and convert binary file into ascii (human readable text).
   -The plugin must obey the COVESA standard log construction format.
   -The header and the payload must be considered as separate parts and be processed sequentially before uploading on Web.

#### b.     Limits: 

   -The plugin should be programmed using native Javascript instead of back-end runtime environment NodeJS or Javascript plugin JQuery.
   -The procedural scripts must be separated and put into different js file so that they can be hidden from users, instead of coding directly onto HTML file.
   -The lack of Javascript deeper knowledge might not seem to be a big matter but it is still a little struggling and challenging to manage searched information and Internet resources.
   -Some features or functions might not be supported by some web browsers.

### 4.  Languages and tools:
   -Javascript
   -HTML
   -VScode
   -Web browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox)

### 5.  Enhancement: 
   -Please feel free to comment to this part for further investigation and enhancement.
